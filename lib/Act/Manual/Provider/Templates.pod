=head1 Templates for Act Providers

=head2 Custom 404 response

Whenever an user request a page from the Act server, this is responded
to with a C<404 Not Found> status code.  Many providers use this
opportunity to enhance this status code with their own content.

Act comes with its own template for 404 pages, but it is a good idea
to override this with a custom response.

To do so, perform the following steps:

=over 4

=item Create a directory C<static> under $ACTHOME.

=item In that directory, write your content to a file F<error404>.

=back

So, the full path to your custom template is
F<$ACTHOME/static/error404>.  This template is processed with Act's
Template Toolkit, therefore you can use the templates in the
F<$ACTHOME/templates> directory, but it has I<no access> to
configuration data nor to templates customized for a conference.
