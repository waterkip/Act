This section provides a brief history of Act and details the primary
authors and numerous other people who have contributed to it.

=head1 HISTORY

In 2003, when the French Perl Mongers began organising their YAPC::Europe
in Paris, they thought about the web site and what they wanted to do
with it. Starting from Sylvain Lhullier's Java-looking prototype,
Éric Cholet and Philippe Bruhat created a conference web site that
was multilingual, template-driven, and able to manage the users, talks,
schedule and payment. It used mod_perl and Template Toolkit. They promised
they would open the source after cleaning it up a bit.

The following year, when preparing the first French Perl Workshop, Éric
and Philippe worked on a second system, designed from the start to
support everything the old site could do, with one difference: it had to
support multiple conferences.

With the source code from YAPC Europe 2003, two developpers and two
months of spare time were enough for this project to be ready for the
2004 French Perl Workshop (June). Act (A Conference Toolkit) was born.
We wanted to support several French Workshops without having to recode a
conference web site engine every year. Laziness is a lot of work... C<:-)>

At that time, we hoped that by September 2004, the code should be published
and ready to serve other conferences.

The YAPC Europe Foundation was created just after YAPC Europe in Paris,
to help and support the organisation of Perl conferences in Europe. Since
YEF and Act are hosted on the French mongers system, it was only natural
that Act integrated the online payment system sponsored by YEF.

The code was finally published in January 2007.

While Act is not the official Perl conference software,
The Perl Foundation has shown significant interest in Act.
More importantly, the Perl community has used Act to organize about
twenty conferences in Europe and in the U.S. between 2004 and 2007.

However, becoming the official Perl conference software is on the roadmap
of our world domination plan! C<;-)>

Ten years later it turned out that world domination had to be slightly
delayed.  Although Act and the French mongers never stopped to help
organize conferences, the software had accumulated a certain amount of
patina.  Several teams and individuals have started working on the
software, and here's the result: Act is still breathing.

=head1 The Name

The name of the toolkit is Act, not ACT.

Even if it looks like an acronym (inspired by the one of APL), it is
more of an inspirational injunction to conference organizers to forget
about hacking the website and organize their conference. In short: "Act!".

We won't get mad if you spell it ACT, as long as you use it for your
conference...
